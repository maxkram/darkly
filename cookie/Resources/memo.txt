Cookie vulnerabilities often involve insecure cookie handling,
such as cookies lacking the HttpOnly, Secure, or SameSite flags,
making them vulnerable to theft via XSS or man-in-the-middle attacks.

How to Exploit:

Open the browser’s developer tools (F12 → Application → Cookies).
Check the cookies for the website. Look for missing flags:
HttpOnly: Prevents JavaScript access.
Secure: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS.
SameSite: Prevents cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
If any flag is missing, note it as a vulnerability.

'i_am_admin' cookie: 68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327
Google the value and change to the opposite (from false to true),
insert and get the flag
